# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains all Architecture Decision Records for Layer36.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that captures an important architectural decision:
what was decided, why, and what the consequences are. It is written once,
merged into `main`, and then **never modified** — only superseded by a new ADR.

## Why write ADRs?

- Technical decisions made verbally vanish. ADRs make them findable.
- New contributors can see *why* the code is the way it is, not just *what* it does.
- They create accountability: a decision that is hard to write down is a decision
  that hasn't been thought through.
