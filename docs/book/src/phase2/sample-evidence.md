# Sample Evidence

This page explains how to record Phase 2 sample evidence.

The goal is simple: run the same three Rust sample apps on each desktop host and
compare the stdout hashes.

- `layer36-clock`
- `layer36-cat`
- `layer36-curl`

If Linux, macOS, and Windows produce the same stdout for these fixed fixtures,
we have much better evidence that the UAPI behaves the same across hosts.

## Recorder

Run this from the repo root:

```bash
scripts/record-phase2-sample-evidence.sh
```

By default, it writes:

```text
target/phase2-sample-evidence/sample-evidence.md
```

You can choose another output path:

```bash
scripts/record-phase2-sample-evidence.sh target/phase2-sample-evidence/macos-arm64.md
```

For three-host comparison after collecting Linux, macOS, and Windows reports:

```bash
scripts/compare-phase2-sample-evidence.sh \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/linux.md \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/macos.md \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/windows.md
```

If curl is blocked only because localhost binding is restricted on one host,
you can use:

```bash
scripts/compare-phase2-sample-evidence.sh \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/linux.md \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/macos.md \
  target/phase2-sample-evidence/windows.md \
  --allow-blocked-curl
```

## What It Runs

The recorder builds the local CLI and the three Rust sample components. Then it
runs:

1. `layer36-clock` with fixed time, locale, and timezone
2. `layer36-cat` against two small fixture files
3. `layer36-curl` against a local HTTP fixture server

The output file records:

- git commit
- host OS and CPU architecture
- command text
- process exit code
- result status
- stdout SHA-256
- stderr SHA-256
- exact stdout snapshot

## Exit Use

For Phase 2 exit, collect one report from each required desktop host.

The important comparison is the stdout hash for each sample. Host metadata will
be different. The sample stdout hashes should match.

If a host cannot run the curl local-server fixture, record that as a blocker
instead of treating it as cross-host proof.
The recorder does this automatically when localhost binding is blocked: it keeps
clock and cat evidence, and marks curl as blocked.
The comparator can then enforce exact hash matches and fail fast on drift.
