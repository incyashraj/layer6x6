# Phase 2: UAPI v0.1

**Status:** Started
**Estimate:** est. 4 to 8 weeks
**Goal:** Make Layer36 useful for small command line apps.

Phase 2 replaces the temporary Phase 1 host interface with real APIs:

- `io`
- `fs`
- `net`
- `time`
- `locale`

The first draft of those WIT contracts now lives at `wit/layer36/phase2`.
It is not frozen yet, but it is real source code and CI parses it so syntax
mistakes are caught early.

The capability layer has also started. Layer36 can parse a sidecar
`manifest.toml`, check launch-time grants, and carry the session policy into the
runtime. The newest piece is a runtime UAPI guard: it translates calls like
`fs.read ./data/file.txt` or `net.connect api.example.com:443` into the exact
capability check that must pass before an adapter talks to the host OS.

There is also a first dispatcher scaffold now. In simple terms: we have the
place where generated UAPI calls will enter the runtime, get checked by policy,
and then move to the host adapter. The current tests prove denied file and
network calls stop before any adapter code runs.

The Phase 2 WIT also has a Rust host-binding checkpoint now. That means CI asks
Wasmtime to generate bindings for the new `cli` world and checks a few important
names. So far the shape is usable: `run` returns an `i32`, `OpenMode::Read`
exists, and `HttpMethod::Get` exists.

There is also a first Rust guest SDK crate now. It lives at
`crates/bindings-rust`, builds as package `layer36`, and gives app code simple
module names such as `layer36::io`, `layer36::time`, and `layer36::locale`.
The Rust sample apps now use that SDK facade, so normal app code talks to
`layer36::fs::open`, `layer36::net::get`, and `layer36::time::clock` instead of
deep generated binding paths.

The latest runtime piece is the generated type bridge. It maps WIT records and
errors into the dispatcher's Rust types, then back again. Put simply: the
runtime now understands the words that generated WIT code will use when it asks
for files, network, time, locale, and logs.

The generated host traits are also wired for the first useful slice. HTTP,
path-level filesystem operations, time, locale, logs, and stdio now call the
dispatcher, which means UCap sits in front of those calls. A small resource
table now owns opened file and stdio handles, so reads, writes, seeks, stats,
and flushes can route through the adapter without exposing raw host IDs.

The runtime also has an initial Phase 2 execution path now. `layer36 run` keeps
supporting the Phase 1 proof world, then falls back to the Phase 2 `cli` world
and installs the generated UAPI imports. The local adapter currently covers
stdio, basic filesystem calls, time, locale, and a first plain HTTP GET path.
That HTTP path is still small on purpose: it is for localhost and test-server
proofs while HTTPS, redirects, streaming, and production hardening stay open.

There is also a first smoke app under `test/integration/phase2-smoke`. It is not
one of the final sample apps yet. Its job is smaller: prove that a real Phase 2
component can read a file, call time and locale, and print through the UAPI
path. CI builds that component and runs it through `layer36 run` on the host
test matrix. The same smoke app now has a missing-grant test too: without
`fs.read`, the host returns permission denied and the component exits with a
clear stderr message.

The first named sample app has started too. `apps/layer36-clock` is a Rust
component that reads time and locale through UAPI, then prints through UAPI
stdout. The CLI now has a hidden `--test-time` flag, so tests can freeze the
clock and check stable output.

The second sample path has started as well. `apps/layer36-cat` reads app
arguments through `layer36:io/args.raw`, opens files through `layer36:fs/files`,
and writes bytes to UAPI stdout. The tests prove both sides: it reads files with
the right `fs.read` grant, and gets permission denied without that grant.

The third sample path has started now too. `apps/layer36-curl` reads a URL from
Layer36 app args, calls `layer36:net/http-client.get`, and writes the response
body through UAPI stdout. Its first tests use a local HTTP server: with
`net.connect:127.0.0.1:PORT` it fetches, without that grant it exits before the
runtime opens a socket.

The proof apps are:

- `layer36-curl`
- `layer36-cat`
- `layer36-clock`

If Phase 2 works, those apps should produce the same output on Linux, macOS, and
Windows while running through the same Layer36 runtime model.
