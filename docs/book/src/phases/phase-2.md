# Phase 2: UAPI v0.1

**Status:** Started
**Estimate:** est. 4 to 8 weeks
**Goal:** Make Layer36 useful for small command line apps.

Phase 2 replaces the temporary Phase 1 host interface with real APIs:

- `io`
- `fs`
- `net`
- `time`
- `locale`

The first draft of those WIT contracts now lives at `wit/layer36/phase2`.
It is not frozen yet, but it is real source code and CI parses it so syntax
mistakes are caught early.

The capability layer has also started. Layer36 can parse a sidecar
`manifest.toml`, check launch-time grants, and carry the session policy into the
runtime. The newest piece is a runtime UAPI guard: it translates calls like
`fs.read ./data/file.txt` or `net.connect api.example.com:443` into the exact
capability check that must pass before an adapter talks to the host OS.

There is also a first dispatcher scaffold now. In simple terms: we have the
place where generated UAPI calls will enter the runtime, get checked by policy,
and then move to the host adapter. The current tests prove denied file and
network calls stop before any adapter code runs.

The Phase 2 WIT also has a Rust host-binding checkpoint now. That means CI asks
Wasmtime to generate bindings for the new `cli` world and checks a few important
names. So far the shape is usable: `run` returns an `i32`, `OpenMode::Read`
exists, and `HttpMethod::Get` exists.

There is also a first Rust guest SDK crate now. It lives at
`crates/bindings-rust`, builds as package `layer36`, and gives app code simple
module names such as `layer36::io`, `layer36::time`, and `layer36::locale`.
The Rust sample apps now use that SDK facade, so normal app code talks to
`layer36::fs::open`, `layer36::net::get`, and `layer36::time::now_millis`
instead of deep generated binding paths.

The SDK now has its first small helper layer too: argument helpers, stdout and
stderr text helpers, common file helpers, HTTP body helpers, and top-level time
and locale shortcuts. The important rule is still the same: guest apps should
import Layer36 UAPI, not host WASI APIs. The current sample components are
checked for that.
The Rust SDK also has a packaged-crate smoke now: CI creates a temporary app
outside the workspace and checks that it can compile a tiny Layer36 component
against the packaged SDK.

The latest runtime piece is the generated type bridge. It maps WIT records and
errors into the dispatcher's Rust types, then back again. Put simply: the
runtime now understands the words that generated WIT code will use when it asks
for files, network, time, locale, and logs.

The generated host traits are also wired for the first useful slice. HTTP,
path-level filesystem operations, time, locale, logs, and stdio now call the
dispatcher, which means UCap sits in front of those calls. A small resource
table now owns opened file and stdio handles, so reads, writes, seeks, stats,
and flushes can route through the adapter without exposing raw host IDs.

The runtime also has an initial Phase 2 execution path now. `layer36 run` keeps
supporting the Phase 1 proof world, then falls back to the Phase 2 `cli` world
and installs the generated UAPI imports. The local adapter currently covers
stdio, basic filesystem calls, time, locale, and a first plain HTTP request
path. Relative filesystem paths now resolve through an explicit runtime
sandbox root. The default is `.`, and `--sandbox-root <dir>` lets a run point
app-relative file access at a specific directory. Shared path cleanup also keeps
the filesystem adapter and UCap grant matcher using the same rules. It now also
rejects colon-based prefix forms up front, so Windows drive-style and alternate
data stream style paths do not cross host-specific parsing rules. For relative
paths, the local adapter now checks canonical existing targets, or the canonical
parent for new files, before host I/O. If a symlink would take the path outside
the sandbox root, the adapter denies the call. On Unix and Windows hosts, file
open also uses a no-follow final-symlink flag, so the final filename cannot be
a symlink at open time.
Destructive filesystem operations now go through a shared operation-intent check
too. That means remove and rename cannot target root-like paths such as `.` or
`/` before the adapter reaches native host I/O.

The HTTP path is still small on purpose: it is for localhost and
test-server proofs while HTTPS, redirects, streaming, and production hardening
stay open. It now forwards lower-level `fetch` methods, app headers, and
buffered bodies, while keeping host-controlled transport headers owned by the
adapter. It also has a response-size guard and typed errors for oversized
responses, timeouts, and malformed HTTP responses, so apps can react to the real
problem instead of receiving one generic network failure. The shared URL parser
now also rejects whitespace, control characters, empty ports, and port `0`
before anything reaches the request line or socket layer. It also rejects
unsupported authority forms in this early plain-HTTP slice and rejects control
characters in app-provided header values. `Transfer-Encoding` is now treated as
host-controlled with `Host`, `Connection`, and `Content-Length`.
The runtime's network capability gate now also uses a shared endpoint parser for
`http://` and `https://` URLs, so policy checks and adapter-side URL validation
no longer drift as separate parsers evolve. The plain `http://` URL parser now
reuses that same authority parsing path to keep host/port validation in one
place.

Time is also starting to move into shared adapter code. The local runtime now
uses a common host clock helper for fixed test time, Unix-epoch milliseconds,
monotonic elapsed time, and sleep. That keeps future desktop adapters from each
making slightly different clock choices. It now also guards edge cases:
monotonic nanoseconds saturate instead of wrapping, and out-of-range
Unix-millisecond values fail with a clear conversion error.

Locale has the same first shared path now. The runtime uses common helper code
for `LC_ALL`/`LANG` locale detection, `TZ` fallback, basic locale normalization,
and the current deterministic formatting placeholder. Real ICU4X formatting and
native per-OS locale discovery are still open, but the early behavior now has
one home instead of being copied in the runtime.

There is also a first smoke app under `test/integration/phase2-smoke`. It is not
one of the final sample apps yet. Its job is smaller: prove that a real Phase 2
component can read a file, call time and locale, and print through the UAPI
path. CI builds that component and runs it through `layer36 run` on the host
test matrix. The same smoke app now has a missing-grant test too: without
`fs.read`, the host returns permission denied and the component exits with a
clear stderr message.

The first named sample app has started too. `apps/layer36-clock` is a Rust
component that reads time and locale through UAPI, then prints through UAPI
stdout. The CLI now has a hidden `--test-time` flag, so tests can freeze the
clock and check stable output.

The second sample path has started as well. `apps/layer36-cat` reads app
arguments through `layer36:io/args.raw`, opens files through `layer36:fs/files`,
and writes bytes to UAPI stdout. The tests prove both sides: it reads files with
the right `fs.read` grant, and gets permission denied without that grant. It
also denies a file outside the granted glob with exit code `5`, matching the
CLI's permission-denied convention.

The third sample path has started now too. `apps/layer36-curl` reads a URL from
Layer36 app args, calls `layer36:net/http-client.get`, and writes the response
body through UAPI stdout. Its first tests use a local HTTP server: with
`net.connect:127.0.0.1:PORT` it fetches, without that grant it exits before the
runtime opens a socket. Permission denial also exits with code `5`.
Oversized responses, timeouts, and malformed HTTP responses now print specific
curl messages too.

The generated UAPI reference has also grown past a raw signature list. It now
pulls capability strings from the manifest crate and adds short behavior notes
under each function and resource method, so the docs explain both the call shape
and the permission model in one place.

The first terminal grant prompt exists too. `layer36 run --prompt app.wasm`
shows the app identity, lists missing manifest capabilities, accepts all or a
numbered subset, and stores the approved caps only for that run. In a normal
terminal the same prompt can appear automatically when required capabilities
are missing. In non-interactive runs, Layer36 keeps the safer behavior and
fails with a clear permission message.

There is now a small manifest trust check as well. If the sidecar manifest says
the app entry is `app.wasm`, then `layer36 run` must be pointed at that same
file. Running a different component with that manifest is rejected before any
grant prompt or runtime execution.

For debugging, `layer36 run --dump-caps app.wasm` now prints the effective
session capabilities and exits before the component starts. It is a simple way
to see what the current grant resolution actually produced.

The proof apps are:

- `layer36-curl`
- `layer36-cat`
- `layer36-clock`

If Phase 2 works, those apps should produce the same output on Linux, macOS, and
Windows while running through the same Layer36 runtime model.
