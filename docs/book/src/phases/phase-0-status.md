## Current local verification

The local baseline is:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
scripts/setup.sh
```

Additional checks:

```bash
mdbook build docs/book
cargo deny check advisories licenses bans sources
```
