# Layer36 for Everyone

Updated on May 6, 2026.

This page explains the project in plain language. It is written for people who are not deep in systems programming.

## The Problem We Are Solving

Most software teams build the same product many times.

- One code path for Windows
- One for macOS
- One for Linux
- One for Android
- One for iOS
- One for web

That costs time, money, and focus.

Layer36 is trying to reduce that duplication. The long term goal is one app model that can run across many hosts.

## The Basic Idea

The app runs as a WebAssembly component. WebAssembly is a portable binary format.  
The app does not call host APIs directly. It calls Layer36 APIs.  
The host adapter translates those calls to the real operating system.

    D --> E["Host adapter"]
    E --> F["Native OS and hardware"]
```

## What Is Working Right Now

1. The runtime can execute one component on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
2. The Phase 2 API surface is active for CLI style apps:
   - file access
   - network requests
   - time and locale
   - standard input and output
3. Sample apps are implemented:
   - `layer36-clock`
   - `layer36-cat`
   - `layer36-curl`
4. Capability checks are in place, so apps only get access they request and are granted.
5. Language fixture automation is active:
   - TypeScript fixtures are built automatically in CI
   - Go fixture promotion is now attempted automatically when TinyGo tools are available
   - strict Go modes fail clearly if Go fixtures are missing or not import-pure
6. The Rust sample apps now have a repeatable evidence recorder, so each host
   can produce the same kind of proof file for clock, cat, and curl.

## Current Build Timeline

Green is complete. Yellow is active. Gray is planned.

## How Close We Are to the Big Goal

The vision is a full 6 by 6 host matrix.

- We have strong desktop runtime proof.
- We have early useful API coverage for command line apps.
- We do not have full GUI, mobile, or store distribution yet.

So we are beyond concept stage, but not near final product stage yet.

## Progress Snapshot

This is a simple status view for non technical readers.

| Area | Status today |
|---|---|
| Runtime base | Working |
| Security model (capability checks) | Working in current Phase 2 scope |
| CLI sample apps | Working |
| Desktop GUI path | Not started in implementation |
| Mobile host path | Not started in implementation |
| Packaging and app store style distribution | Not started in implementation |

## Key Terms in Simple Words

- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: A portable binary format that can run on different systems through a runtime.
- **Runtime**: The engine that loads and executes the app component.
- **UAPI**: The app facing API that Layer36 exposes. This is how apps ask for files, network, time, and more.
- **Host adapter**: The translation layer from Layer36 calls to native operating system calls.
- **Capability**: A specific permission, such as reading files from one path or connecting to one network endpoint.

## What Happens Next

The main Phase 2 work still open is:

1. Deeper adapter hardening and platform parity checks.
2. Full Go runtime fixture proof with Layer36 import-pure bindings across runners.
3. Cross host confidence gates staying green over time.

When those are done, we can exit Phase 2 and start Phase 3 desktop UI work.
