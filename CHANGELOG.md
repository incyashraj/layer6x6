## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial repository scaffold: licenses, README, CI, ADR-0001.
- Phase Plans (0–7) and Build Plan in `Plan/`.
- `docs/adr/` with ADR template and ADR-0001.
- `docs/book/` mdBook scaffold.
- Phase 0 workspace sentinel so baseline Cargo commands succeed before runtime crates exist.
- Code of Conduct, first-PR guide, legal search record, launch drafts, and setup script scaffolding.
- mdBook CI coverage on pull requests.
- Phase 0 status tracker, repository label definitions, and good-first-issue drafts.
- Preliminary naming/trademark risk record and external setup checklists.
- Project rename from OneOS to Layer36 across plans, docs, CLI placeholders, WIT examples, and bundle naming.
- Phase 1 runtime and CLI crate scaffolds with `layer36 run`, `layer36 version`, and `layer36 doctor`.
- ADR-0002 and ADR-0003 for Wasmtime and Component Model decisions.
- Phase 1 WIT interface and Rust hello-world component fixture that prints through the Layer36 host import.
- CI-backed Phase 1 hello fixture test with SHA-256 logging and `layer36 run` output assertion.
- Phase 1 fuel and memory limit enforcement with clear `limit exceeded` CLI exits.
- Phase 1 release packaging workflow and local package script for tar.gz/zip artifacts.
- Phase 1 quickstart for building and running the hello-world component.
- Phase 1 Threat Model v0.1 and updated security scope.
- Phase 1 Criterion benchmark suite, warning-only regression check, and published local baseline.
- Phase 1 test harness script that builds the hello component before running workspace tests.
- Shared Phase 1 CI hello fixture artifact so Linux, macOS, and Windows run the same `.wasm` bytes and assert the same SHA-256.
