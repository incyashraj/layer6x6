## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared Phase 2 ASCII-only URL input hardening in `adapter-common`: plain-HTTP URL parsing and shared endpoint extraction now reject non-ASCII URL input so early request-line framing and capability checks stay deterministic.
- Shared Phase 2 locale-tag canonicalization hardening in `adapter-common`: locale normalization now canonicalizes subtag casing (language/script/region), rejects malformed locale-tag shapes, and falls back to `en-US`; timezone normalization now rejects control-character values and falls back to `UTC`.
- Shared Phase 2 URL scheme-case parsing parity in `adapter-common`: `http`/`https` scheme handling is now case-insensitive in endpoint parsing, and mixed-case `HTTP://` plain URL inputs are accepted by the shared plain HTTP parser.
- Shared Phase 2 filesystem path trailing-segment hardening in `adapter-common`: path parsing now rejects segments ending in `.` or a trailing space before sandbox resolution and host I/O, reducing Windows normalization edge cases.
- Shared Phase 2 plain HTTP request-target size guard in `adapter-common`: oversized path/query targets are now rejected during URL parsing before request framing and socket writes.
- Runtime network-policy parity test for host-case normalization: mixed-case URL hosts are now explicitly covered in dispatcher tests to confirm lowercase `net.connect` grants still match.
- Shared Phase 2 host-case normalization in `adapter-common`: accepted URL hosts are now normalized to lowercase during endpoint parsing so policy checks treat `EXAMPLE.com` and `example.com` as the same endpoint.
- Shared Phase 2 strict buffered `Content-Length` validation: shared plain HTTP response parsing now rejects any truncated body, including empty buffered bodies when a non-zero length is declared.
- Shared Phase 2 plain HTTP request-body guard in `adapter-common`: buffered request framing now rejects bodies above a fixed early-phase cap and maps them through runtime fetch as `body-too-large`.
- Shared Phase 2 plain HTTP response integrity checks in `adapter-common`: the shared response parser now rejects unsupported response `Transfer-Encoding`, conflicting `Content-Length` headers, and mismatched buffered body lengths in this early plain-HTTP slice.
- Shared Phase 2 HTTP response read-loop hardening in `adapter-common`: full-response reads now use one helper that enforces byte limits and maps timeout-style socket reads before response parsing.
- Shared Phase 2 host-name validation hardening in `adapter-common`: domain labels now reject leading/trailing `-`, label lengths are bounded, and numeric-dot hosts must parse as valid IPv4 literals.
- Shared Phase 2 plain HTTP response parser hardening in `adapter-common`: runtime fetch parsing now uses one shared parser that validates HTTP/1.0/1.1 version, status-code range, header count limits, header syntax, and safe header values before data is returned to app-facing response types.
- Shared Phase 2 deterministic locale formatting baseline in `adapter-common`: date styles now format Unix-millis timestamps into stable UTC date/time strings, and number styles now return deterministic decimal/percent/currency text from locale hints.
- Optional Phase 2 Go/TypeScript runtime fixture assertions in `crates/cli/tests/cli.rs` behind `LAYER36_GO_*` and `LAYER36_TS_*` WASM env vars, plus `scripts/test-phase2-language-variants.sh` and CI/self-hosted workflow hooks that auto-skip until variant components are supplied.
- Go and TypeScript Phase 2 `layer36-cat` sample variants under `packages/sdk-go/examples` and `packages/sdk-ts/examples`, plus stricter SDK shape checks that assert cat/clock/curl sample behavior contracts.
- Hidden Phase 2 deterministic clock-fixture controls: `layer36 run --test-locale` and `--test-timezone`, runtime wiring for locale/timezone overrides, and a strict `layer36-clock` snapshot test with fixed time + locale + timezone for cross-host output comparison.
- Shared Phase 2 Windows reserved-name path hardening in `adapter-common`: path segments that map to device-style names (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, `LPT1`-`LPT9`) are now rejected before sandbox resolution and host I/O.
- Shared Phase 2 authority parser reuse across network paths: plain `http://` URL parsing now reuses the same host/port parser used by runtime endpoint policy checks, with extra runtime tests for invalid-URL short-circuiting and default port grant behavior.
- Shared Phase 2 URL endpoint parsing for policy checks: `adapter-common` now provides `parse_url_endpoint` for `http://` and `https://`, and runtime network capability checks use this shared parser instead of separate endpoint parsing logic.
- Shared Phase 2 filesystem path prefix hardening in `adapter-common`: colon-based path forms are now rejected before host I/O, including Windows drive-style prefixes and alternate-data-stream style suffixes.
- Shared Phase 2 plain HTTP authority and header-value hardening in `adapter-common`: unsupported authority forms are rejected in this early slice, control characters in app header values are denied, and `Transfer-Encoding` is treated as host-controlled.
- Windows host file opens now apply a no-follow final-symlink flag (`FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`) for Phase 2 sandbox paths.
- Shared Phase 2 host-clock overflow guards in `adapter-common`: monotonic nanoseconds now saturate at `u64::MAX`, and out-of-range Unix-millis conversion is rejected with explicit error handling.
- Phase 2 plain HTTP URL validation now rejects request-line whitespace/control characters and empty or zero ports before socket access.
- Shared Phase 2 filesystem operation intents in `adapter-common`, with runtime guards that reject destructive root-like remove and rename targets before native host I/O.
- Shared Phase 2 locale helpers in `adapter-common`, covering `LC_ALL`/`LANG` locale detection, `TZ` fallback, and BCP 47-ish normalization.
- Shared Phase 2 host clock helpers in `adapter-common`, including fixed test time, Unix-epoch millisecond conversion, monotonic elapsed time, and sleep.
- Unix host file opens now use a no-follow final-symlink flag for Phase 2 sandbox paths, reducing open-time symlink race risk.
- Symlink escape checks for relative Phase 2 filesystem paths resolved through the runtime sandbox root.
- `layer36 run --sandbox-root <dir>` and runtime sandbox-root resolution for relative Phase 2 filesystem paths.
- Shared Phase 2 filesystem path normalization in `adapter-common`, with runtime filesystem calls and policy resource matching using the same rules.
- `crates/adapter-common` as the first shared host-adapter crate, starting with plain HTTP URL parsing and request framing used by the runtime.
- Phase 2 plain HTTP `fetch(req)` now sends the selected method, app headers, and buffered body while keeping transport headers under host control.
- `scripts/smoke-rust-sdk.sh` to package the Rust SDK and check a fresh outside-workspace component against the packaged crate.
- Generated UAPI reference pages now include function-level behavior notes for the Phase 2 interfaces and resource methods.
- `layer36-curl` now prints clearer messages for oversized, timed-out, and malformed HTTP responses.
- Phase 2 HTTP timeout and protocol failures now map to WIT `net-error.timeout` and `net-error.protocol`.
- Phase 2 HTTP oversized-response errors now map to the WIT `net-error.body-too-large` variant instead of a generic connection failure.
- Phase 2 policy coverage tests now prove every supported capability name has a UAPI call mapping and every current dispatcher adapter method is reached through the policy gate.
- ADR-0006, ADR-0007, and ADR-0008 for Phase 2 WIT versioning, UCap soft enforcement, and host async runtime direction.
- `layer36 run --max-http-response-bytes` to tune the Phase 2 plain HTTP adapter response-size guard per run.
- `layer36 run --log-grants-format jsonl` to append one structured grant audit record per line for scripts and local tooling.
- `layer36 run --dump-caps-format json` to print effective run grants, app identity, and component path as structured data before starting a component.
- A 1 MiB response-size guard in the Phase 2 plain HTTP adapter so early network tests have deterministic host-side bounds.
- `layer36 manifest check --format json` and `layer36 manifest capabilities --format json`, making all manifest inspection commands script-friendly.
- `layer36 manifest explain --format json` for tools that need a structured view of app identity, requested capabilities, default grants, resources, and launch-grant needs.
- `layer36 run --log-grants <file>` to append app identity and effective session capabilities to a local grant audit log.
- Phase 1 to Phase 2 migration note explaining how the temporary `print`/`exit` proof path maps to the real UAPI, manifest, and grant model.
- Phase 2 Rust walkthrough showing the current SDK, component build, manifest generation, manifest explanation, granted run, and denial path.
- `layer36 manifest explain` to show app identity, requested capabilities, default grants, launch-grant needs, resources, and rationales in human-readable form.
- `layer36 manifest init` to generate starter Phase 2 `manifest.toml` files with validated app metadata and capability strings.
- Initial `packages/sdk-go` Go/TinyGo SDK scaffold with Phase 2 UAPI helper packages, clock/curl examples, and a dependency-free package shape check in CI.
- Initial `@layer36/sdk` TypeScript package scaffold with Phase 2 UAPI import declarations, helper modules, examples, and a dependency-free package shape check in CI.
- `layer36 doctor` now reports Phase 2 language-binding tool readiness for TinyGo, Go, Node, npm, and jco.
- Fixture-backed sample manifest tests proving `layer36-clock`, `layer36-cat`, and `layer36-curl` run through their sample `manifest.toml` files with `--auto-grant`.
- Phase 2 component import checker that rejects non-`layer36:*` imports in built sample components, wired into full hosted CI and self-hosted CI.
- Phase 2 component startup benchmarks for the smoke UAPI app and `layer36-clock`, including a first local runtime-path read in the mdBook benchmark notes.
- Phase 2 UAPI dispatch benchmark target and docs, with first local sub-microsecond results for default IO, filesystem grants, denial path, and network grant checks.
- Phase 2 UCap denial coverage for filesystem `stat`, `list`, `remove`, `mkdir`, and `rename`, proving they stop before adapter calls when grants are missing.
- Phase 2 stdio stream UCap hardening: stream handles now remember whether they came from stdin, stdout, or stderr, and stream read/write/flush methods re-check that capability before adapter work.
- Phase 2 file-handle UCap hardening: read-write opens now require both read and write grants, and file resource read/write/stat/seek methods re-check path capabilities before adapter calls.
- Generated UAPI reference capability tables now come from the same manifest crate table used by validation and `layer36 manifest capabilities`.

- Manifest entry hardening for `layer36 run`: when a sidecar manifest is present, its `app.entry` must match the `.wasm` being run.
- First terminal grant prompt for Phase 2 manifest capabilities via `layer36 run --prompt`, while non-interactive runs still fail cleanly when required grants are missing.
- Rust guest SDK helper layer for Phase 2 apps, including argument helpers, stream text helpers, file read/write helpers, HTTP text helpers, time/locale shortcuts, and a public Rust SDK guide.

### Changed
- `layer36-cat` and `layer36-curl` now parse Layer36 raw app args directly so their built components import only Layer36 UAPI, with no accidental WASI Preview 2 host imports.
- CI is temporarily manual-only while the GitHub account's Actions billing/spending limit is blocked; local checks remain the required development gate.
- Reduced normal GitHub Actions usage by keeping push CI on cheap Linux checks and moving the full Linux/macOS/Windows matrix, benchmarks, and cargo-deny audit behind manual full CI or `[full-ci]`.
- Render Mermaid flowcharts as diagrams on the published mdBook site.
- Reworked the public mdBook docs into clearer human language, added system flow diagrams, and changed the roadmap from fixed fixed-month language to estimates.
